                <p>David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                statement that it was all their original work.</p>

                <p>Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'</p>

                <p>End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                and pasting to cover assignment work.</p>

                <p>Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
                But IT lecturers are a funny lot.</p>

                <p>Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.</p>

                <p>"I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                IE7.</p>

                <p>'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                present a talk on internet security."</p>

                <h3>published 26/03/23</h3>
                <p>Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.</p>

                <p>"I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                front of a room full of students.</p>

                <p>So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.</p>

                <p>Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                since been decommissioned.</p>

                <p>Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'</p>

                <p>And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                their computers with care!"</p>
